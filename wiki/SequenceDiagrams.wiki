= IB API =
Here is how today existing IB API works (approximatively):

One can see that problems can occur during callback methods (red colored): tickPrice(), tickSize()... as it is the same thread (EReader) reading from InputStream and executing code within these callback methods.

You must avoid long operations or performances will decrease *dramatically*. Funny thing is you may listen to tick price events to trigger process which then place orders or store data in a database for example.

To avoid these blocking (long) operations, one has to implement multi-threading design in its code so that EReader thread is released faster and it can process a new event.
