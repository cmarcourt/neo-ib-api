One can see that problems can occur during callback methods (red colored): tickPrice(), tickSize()... as it is the same thread (EReader) reading from InputStream and executing code within these callback methods.

You must avoid long operations or performances will decrease *dramatically*. Funny thing is you may listen to tick price events to trigger process which then place orders for example or store data in a database.
